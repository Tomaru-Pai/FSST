Echoserver is an application which is listening
to PORT 5000 of the local machine.

With "nc localhost 5000" in a sepperate bash
you can send messages to the application.

The app will call when a connection is made

When you type something in the other bash you
will get the message and the mirrored message
in the application

When the connection is lost it will also
send a message.
